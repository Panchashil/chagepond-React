*React: -it is javascript library.
        -it is use to create rich UI.
        -it create single page application(SPA).
        -it not framework.
        -latest version of react is 18 

 -react work on component basis 
 -in react root component name is app.js 
        
Technology you must know 
-Html,css,js(basic js,ES5 and ES6 , oops)

-s/w pre-requisit.
-nodejs 
-npm 
-editor 

*There are two way to react project 
1.By npx: in this case no need to install configuration 
 step1: npx create-react-app appname
 step2: cd appname
 step3:npm start  

2.By npm:in this case w have to install configuration file
 step1:npm install create-react-app
 step2:create-react-app appname
 step3:cd appname
 step4:npm start  

*what is component
-it is partial pert of react project.
-it can be any part of project.
-which we can resuse.

*In React we have two types of component.
1.function component: when your main goal is create UI 
2.class component: when you need to deal with essential data and need to write complex logic in that case we use it.

*How to display individual component output.
 
*props(property): 
-it is parameter or functional parameter which is use to pass data inside component.
-props return data in object formate.
-in function component we can access props like props.propsName.
-in class component we can access props like this.props.propsName.

*JSX(javascript XML):
-it makes react code easy and allows us to write html code in react component.
-in jsx we have to write one parent element to wrap another child element, parent element can be any block element.

*State in class component 
-state in class component it is use to handle essential data.
-in class component we write state in constructor.
-state return us object type of data.
-we can access data outside state by writting this.state.propertyname 

*setState(): it allows us to manipulate state property value.

*destrucring of state 
*destrucring of props 

Task
create a class component with name MyDetails containg props fname,lname,email,contact as well as state with property gender,maritial status,address and display is data on browser.

* method and event.
-use define methode 
-events : onClick 
          onMouseOver 

create class SetStateComp display its output.

Task: write methode to decrement counter value by one

Rendering: display component output or view on browser.
*conditional Rendering: display component output on the basis of condition.
1.if else: if condition is true then if block will render otherwise else block render
2.element as variable: in this we store data in variable and return that variable as element
3.use of ternary operator: it is an shorthand of if else.
                          syntax:  condition ? trupart : falsepart;
4.use of short-circuit: in this if condition is true then and only then it will return output.
                        -it is denoted by &&.

*How to display images in react component
*how to create constant file to shae data with component. 

Task1: toggle image when we click on single button 
Task1: change multiple image when we click on multiple button button 

*component interaction: 
-fetching data from parent component to child component.
-how to make parent child relation between two component.
-to make parent child relation in between component for that we import child component in parent 
and write child component name as tag in parent component.

*send state data as props to child component
*send method  as props to child component

*We saw snipet for creating component
rce : for creating class component
rconst:create constructor with super method and state 

rfce : it will generate normal function component
rafce : it will generate arrow function component

Fragment or React.Fragment : 
-it is an alternative for jsx, which removes unwanted element from react project.
-to use we have to import it from react library.

*How to use css in react 
1. internal css: we can write css inside component.
2. external css : in this we create a seperate css file and that css file we import in component
3. module css : -if you have to write css property for a seperate component for that we use it.
                - we can create module css file by fileName.module.css 
                -then we have to import it in component.

*HOC(Heigher Ordr Component) :
-when we have comman bussines logic and want to share with multiple component for that we use it.
-in hoc we can share data from function component to other component.
-in hoc we pass other function as parameter.


*How to use Bootstrap in React 
-itm provide inbult classes to make webapp attractive responce
step1:npm i bootstrap
step2: import it in index.js 
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
step3: use its classes in react component


*How to use Material UI(MUI)
-it ia an external library which provide inbuilt component to react.
-it makes react app attractive,responsive 
-its official website is mui.com 

command to install Material UI 
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

command to install material icon 
npm install @mui/icons-material

*How to use Carousel from MUI 

npm i react-swipeable-views --legacy-peer-deps 

*Routing In React.
-navigation of component.
-display component output by writting it pathname in browser url 
-to perform routing we use "react-router-dom" library.
-how to install react-router-dom
npm i react-router-dom
or 
npm i react-router-dom --legacy-peer-deps

types of routing 

1. naming routing : display component output b y writting its path name in browser url
2. default routing: display component output without writting path in browser url.
3. parameterize routing : passing parameter with routing path and display component output.
4.child routing: defining one routing inside another routing. 
                in this to display child component output in parent component we import <Outlet /> 
                directory in parent component and write in render method as tag.

5.whild-card routing: display component output when user enter wrong path name in browser url.
                  -it is denoted by *.
                  -it must be last routing , it below routing will never work.

*we saw how to design layout 

Task: create layout as shown in image by using Material UI in react 
===================================================================================

Virtual DOM: in react instead of manipulating browser dom directly react create virtual DOm in its memory, where it does all necessary changes in it, and virtual dom changes thats needs to be change.

*Hooks In React:
-it allows us to use class component feature in function component.
-hooks introduce in react version 16

Rules to use Hooks 
-Hooks work only with function component.
-Hooks always use at top level component.
-Hooks can not be render conditinaly. 

*List of Hooks 
1.useState Hook : it allows us to use State in function component.
                 -it gives two values 1.current-state,2.function-to-update-state 
                 -before use first we have to import from react library.

2.useEffect Hook : 
  -it is use to perform sideeffect operation in function component after render of it.
  -sideeffect means what , fetching data from server,use of timer
  -it execute once after component render.
  -it takes two parameter in it, 1.callback function, 2. dependency
  -first we have to import it from react library before use of it. 
  syntax:   useEffect(()=>{},dependency);

 case1: when no dependency value pass , it will execute after every render
      syntax:   useEffect(()=>{});

case:2: when we want to execute useEffect only once render 
       -in this we pass dependency value as blanck array.
       syntax:   useEffect(()=>{},[]);

case3: when we want to execute useEffect hook as our choice.
      -to chive we have state or props as dependency value.
      -as state or prop value change then useEffect will execute.
      syntax:   useEffect(()=>{},[state or props]);


3.useContext Hook
4.useRef Hook 
5.UseReducer Hook 
6.useMemo Hook 
7.useCallback Hook. 
8.custome Hook.
