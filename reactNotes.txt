*what is component
-it is partial pert of react project.
-it can be any part of project.
-which we can resuse.

*In React we have two types of component.
1.function component: when your main goal is create UI 
2.class component: when you need to deal with essential data and need to write complex logic in that case we use it.

*How to display individual component output.
 
*props(property): 
-it is parameter or functional parameter which is use to pass data inside component.
-props return data in object formate.
-in function component we can access props like props.propsName.
-in class component we can access props like this.props.propsName.

*JSX(javascript XML):
-it makes react code easy and allows us to write html code in react component.
-in jsx we have to write one parent element to wrap another child element, parent element can be any block element.

*State in class component 
-state in class component it is use to handle essential data.
-in class component we write state in constructor.
-state return us object type of data.
-we can access data outside state by writting this.state.propertyname 

*setState(): it allows us to manipulate state property value.

*destrucring of state 
*destrucring of props 

Task
create a class component with name MyDetails containg props fname,lname,email,contact as well as state with property gender,maritial status,address and display is data on browser.

* method and event.
-use define methode 
-events : onClick 
          onMouseOver 

create class SetStateComp display its output.

Task: write methode to decrement counter value by one

Rendering: display component output or view on browser.
*conditional Rendering: display component output on the basis of condition.
1.if else: if condition is true then if block will render otherwise else block render
2.element as variable: in this we store data in variable and return that variable as element
3.use of ternary operator: it is an shorthand of if else.
                          syntax:  condition ? trupart : falsepart;
4.use of short-circuit: in this if condition is true then and only then it will return output.
                        -it is denoted by &&.

*How to display images in react component
*how to create constant file to shae data with component. 

Task1: toggle image when we click on single button 
Task1: change multiple image when we click on multiple button button 

*component interaction: 
-fetching data from parent component to child component.
-how to make parent child relation between two component.
-to make parent child relation in between component for that we import child component in parent 
and write child component name as tag in parent component.

*send state data as props to child component
*send method  as props to child component

*We saw snipet for creating component
rce : for creating class component
rconst:create constructor with super method and state 

rfce : it will generate normal function component
rafce : it will generate arrow function component
